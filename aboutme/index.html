    <p>Hey guys, my name is Blake and I am 19 years old. I am thinking of a computer science degree or engineering. In my freetime I play a lot of sports and do a lot of things outdoors like camping, snowmobiling, and skiing.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this course to extend my knowledge on web development and to see if this is a career path I want to pursue. So far I have loved classes like this, so I'm sure I will love this class too.</p>
